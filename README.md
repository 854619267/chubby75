RV901T LED "Receiver Card"
=========================

<img src="doc/front.jpg" />

This repository contains bits and pieces about the Linsn RV901T HUB75 LED driver card, also known as a "Receiver Card". Its stock function is to receive and forward framebuffer data using a proprietary protocol (from a "Sender Card") and blit out control signals to LED panels (via shields, like a HUB75 shield).

As it contains a user-reprogrammable Spartan 6 FPGA (LX16, 14k 'logic cells', 9112 LUTs) and 2x GbE, it has potential to be usable as a general purpose FPGA development board, an interface card for various purposes, or a logic analyzer.

**Chubby75** is a project to reverse engineer, document and provide tools based on this card.

Hardware
--------

There is [hardware documention](doc/hardware.md) available, which includes WIP information about mapping from the FPGA balls / IO into various peripherals on board and connectors.
